# Easy Vercel Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Prepare Your Files

Your website is ready for deployment! Make sure you have these files:
- `vercel.json` âœ“
- `requirements-vercel.txt` âœ“ 
- All your website files âœ“

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

1. Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository
2. Name it something like "my-portfolio-website"
3. Upload all your files to this repository

## Step 3: Deploy on Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select your GitHub repository
5. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Python project

### Important Settings:
- **Framework Preset**: Other
- **Root Directory**: ./
- **Build Command**: Leave empty
- **Output Directory**: Leave empty

## Step 4: Environment Variables (Optional)

In Vercel dashboard, go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables and add:
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Any random text (like: mysecretkey123)

## Step 5: Deploy

Click "Deploy" and wait 2-3 minutes. Your website will be live!

## Admin Access

After deployment:
- Go to: `your-website-url.vercel.app/admin/login`
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**Important**: Change the admin password after first login!

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Build Failed
- Make sure `requirements-vercel.txt` exists
- Check that all files are uploaded to GitHub

### Issue: Website Not Working
- Check Vercel function logs in dashboard
- Make sure environment variables are set

### Issue: Database Errors
- The website uses SQLite (file database) which works on Vercel
- Data will reset on each deployment (normal for free hosting)

## Free Hosting Limitations

- Website sleeps after inactivity (normal)
- Database resets on deployments
- Limited storage and bandwidth

This is perfect for portfolio websites and testing!
